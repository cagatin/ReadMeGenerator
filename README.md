# README File Generator
Welcome to my README File Generator!

## What does this do?
This program will aid users in creating a README file for their project. When the index.js file is run in the terminal, a series of prompts will be given to the user to answer. Based on the user's input, a README file will be generated containing all of the responses. 

## Installation Instructions
To begin, you must first install the necessary dependencies for the program via the npm install command in the command line. Once the dependencies have been installed, you can then run the program via the node index.js command.
